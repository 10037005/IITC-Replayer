# IITC-Replayer

I'm fairly certain that both sides of the XMA OP team have long developed their own internal COMM log replay tools. This repository offers just a lightweight, vibe-coding style replayer built on top of IITC. Its main purpose is to give players who don’t have access to OP-level replayers—or who need to share replays in a desensitized form—a way to review activity.

Within this repository:

COMM-Exporter can capture COMM logs within a one-month period. Keep in mind that using it may violate the TOS and could result in account suspension.

Replayer visualizes the exported logs, showing how several given accounts built or destroyed portals and links.

Trajectory-Loader is an earlier version of Replayer. If all you need is to view a specific account’s movement path and approximate speed estimates, this tool is sufficient.
